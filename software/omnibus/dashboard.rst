Dashboard
=========

The **Dashboard** is a crucial sink in the Omnibus system. It is a Qt-based GUI application that provides real-time visualization of data from the ZMQ network using various plots.

Key Features
------------

- **User-friendly interface:** Easy to use and intuitive.
- **Real-time monitoring:** Displays live data from multiple sources and channels.
- **Supports multiple data types:** Monitor data from GPS, IMU, DAQ, and other sensors.
- **Flexible visualization:** View data from different sources and channels simultaneously.

The dashboard is designed to help users efficiently monitor and analyze data from the Omnibus system.

Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Start the dashboard with:

    .. code-block:: shell

        cd sink/dashboard
        python main.py

3. The GUI will launch, displaying the main window with various plots.
4. It will automatically connect to the ZMQ network and start receiving data.
5. To add an item to the dashboard, use the menu bar: **Add Item** â†’ select the desired item.

.. note::

    The title bar of the Omnibus PyQt Dashboard displays a hash representing the current Git version (e.g. 8de2f47) of the Omnibus. Users should take note of this hash, as it is useful for debugging and ensuring consistency between the running dashboard and the codebase version.
